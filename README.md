🧠 From Basic to Advanced RAG Systems
A beginner-friendly learning journey into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
🌟 Overview
This repository is my personal journey to learn and build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems — starting from the very basics and gradually moving toward advanced setups.
If you’ve ever wondered how ChatGPT-style systems can look up external knowledge and generate context-aware answers, RAG is what makes it possible! The goal here is to break that complex concept into small, practical steps anyone can follow.
